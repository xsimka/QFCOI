# QFCOI
##  Enhancing Objective Quality Assessment for Compressed Omnidirectional Images with Fusion of Measures

Repository provides a example code of objective OIQA method, Quality Fusion of Compressed Omnidirectional Images (QFCOI), optimized for compressed omnidirectional images by emerging codecs such as JPEG XL, AVIF, HEIC. In addition, the repository offers some validation results, such as for the development and test of performance evaluation methods.
Completion will be in the next few days.

### Datasets for validation
Proposed method performance was validated on [OMNIQAD](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.7607070) and [CVIQ](https://github.com/sunwei925/CVIQDatabase) databases. 
- OMNIQAD (75 distorted images by AVIF, HEIC and JPEG XL based on 5 reference images)
- CVIQ (176 distorted images by HEVC based on 16 reference images)
